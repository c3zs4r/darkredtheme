**What is this?**
-------------------------------

This is a dark grey theme for Aseprite that I created by editing the original default skin 
made by David Capello and Ilija Melentijevic, because I like dark grey themes.

**How to Install**
-------------------------------

Download the files from [github.com/c3zs4r/darkredtheme](https://github.com/c3zs4r/darkredtheme) by clicking the "Clone or Download" button in the top right, then selecting "Download ZIP".

Start up Aseprite and go into Edit -> Preferences -> Extensions and click "Add Extension", then navigate to where you saved the .zip and select it, then click OK. 

Then switch over to "Theme" in the list on the left in the Preferences window, then click the theme "aseprite-dark-red-theme" and click Select, and it should update right away.
If the theme doesn't show up, try restarting the program to allow it to load in.
